# Proper image treatments.

This code is inspired on Zackay & Ofek 2015 papers *How to coadd images?*
[I](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.06872) and [II](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.06879).

It can perform the statistical proper coadd of several images using a spatially
variant PSF estimation.

Images need to be aligned and registered.

New documentation is in progress.
